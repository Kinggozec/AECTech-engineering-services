    <h3><a href="#">Innovations in Civil Engineering Materials</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
    Material science is revolutionizing civil engineering with innovations that make structures stronger, more durable, and sustainable.
    </p>
  
    <p><strong>Top Material Innovations</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Self-Healing Concrete</strong>: Bacteria or chemicals heal micro-cracks when exposed to moisture, increasing structural lifespan.</li>
      <li><strong>Geopolymer Concrete</strong>: An eco-friendly cement alternative with high resistance to heat and chemicals.</li>
      <li><strong>Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)</strong>: Lightweight and strong, used for retrofitting bridges and buildings.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Materials</strong>: Shape-memory alloys and piezoelectrics that adapt to environmental conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparent Aluminum & ETFE Membranes</strong>: Used for futuristic architecture, lightweight and energy-efficient.</li>
      <li><strong>Green Concrete</strong>: Made from fly ash or slag, reducing the carbon footprint of traditional concrete.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p><strong>Benefits</strong>

        <br>
    - Improved structural performance
    <br>
    - Lower maintenance costs
    <br>
