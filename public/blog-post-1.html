      Sustainability is no longer a buzzwordâ€”it's a design mandate for modern infrastructure. Engineers, architects, and project managers are increasingly shifting toward eco-friendly materials and processes to reduce the environmental impact of construction and urban development.
    </p>
  
    <h2>1. Eco-Friendly Building Materials</h2>
    <p>
      Materials like recycled steel, fly ash concrete, bamboo, and engineered timber are being used more frequently to reduce the carbon footprint of construction projects. Innovations such as geopolymer concrete are also gaining traction for their reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
    </p>
  
    <h2>2. Smart Energy Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Integrating solar panels, wind turbines, and energy-efficient lighting systems directly into infrastructure allows buildings to generate their own energy. These features are often managed by smart control systems to optimize energy consumption.
    </p>
  
    <h2>3. Water Management Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) are vital for water conservation. Green roofs and permeable pavements are also contributing to better urban water management.
    </p>
  
    <h2>4. Lifecycle Assessment (LCA)</h2>
    <p>
      Engineers now conduct LCAs to evaluate the environmental impact of materials and construction processes over the entire lifespan of a structure. This encourages the selection of materials and techniques with minimal long-term impact.
    </p>
  
    <h2>5. The Future of Sustainable Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
      With climate change challenges growing, the future of civil engineering will heavily depend on resilient, adaptive, and low-impact designs. By embracing innovation and sustainable thinking, the industry is positioned to build a greener tomorrow.
